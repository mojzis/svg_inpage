# SVG in page
Helps to add a piece of SVG into your HTML(5). That can be useful i.e. when you want to write some javascript for the graphics.

## what it does
* include selected file in a page or a block

## how to use
### configuration
* thus far none ;)

### site builders
* sorry, at the moment you have to write some code

### module creators
* see example
* add a hook to define a page or a block

## plans & ideas :

### configuration
* different methods of including the file
* try to find a js library to show the svg in older browsers
* attempt a raphael display, too

### own pages
* create an entity with :
  * file
  * address
  * settings
* think of a way to allow the same in code (features, ctools ...)

### caching
* cache the changed files !
* cache the definitions (?)
  * pages
  * blocks

### add tests

### make the code more OO
* file , page ?

### EXAMPLE MODULE


### javascript
* jQuery('svg g').attr('id')

### svg manipulation
* set width and weigth automatically to 100%

### other stuff
* blocks
* field & views handler
* media cooperation ?
* anything else ?

### advanced help
